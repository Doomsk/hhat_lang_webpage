:math:`\hat{H}` documentation
=============================

Welcome to the :math:`\hat{H}` documentation. 

:math:`\hat{H}` *reads as 'H-hat'. In Quantum Mechanics, it is a quantum operator that deals with the system energy and its dynamics.*

It is a quantum programming language (QPL) aimed to build quantum algorithms through higher abstraction layers of gates instructions. Users should have **no** *extensive* prior knowledge in quantum computing to make use of the power of quantum computers and quantum networks.

This is a work in progress, thus many aspects of the language may change throughout the process. Below, you can check the curent available contents for the language.
