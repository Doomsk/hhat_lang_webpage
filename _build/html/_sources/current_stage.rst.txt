Current Stage
=============


Currently, it is an interpreted language prototyped in **Python**. It is possible to run the lexer, parser and evaluate (interpret) some small codes. That includes basic arithmetic, with built-in function calls and some simple quantum data operations.

The goal in the future is to turn it into a compiled language using **Rust**, which is well known for its optimization, scalability and speed.
