:math:`\hat{H}` documentation
=============================

Welcome to the :math:`\hat{H}` documentation. You can find its repository on GitHub_.

:math:`\hat{H}` *reads as 'H-hat'. In Quantum Mechanics, it is a quantum operator that deals with the system energy and its dynamics.*

:math:`\hat{H}` is a quantum programming language (QPL) aimed to build quantum algorithms through abstracting low-level concepts found in most QPLs, such as *gates*, *qubits* and *measurements*. Users should have **no** *extensive* prior knowledge in quantum computing to make use of the power of quantum computers and quantum networks.

**Disclaimer**: This is a work in progress, thus many aspects of the language may change throughout the process.
