The language was first idealized and developed by Doomsk_. It came during the development of :code:`C^{\dagger}` language, which started by middle of 2020, where some ideas and purposes started to collide and generate conflict. After a clear understanding of its purpose, :code:`\hat{H}` devised as a different language with its own path, producing the core structure of the original :math:`C^{\dagger}` language. Thus, they were set apart in the beginning of 2022. Currently, the language is being developed by Doomsk_, Lucas_, Adonai_, Kaonan_ and Anneriet_.
