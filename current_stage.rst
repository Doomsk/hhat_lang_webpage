Current Stage
=============


Currently, it is prototyped in **Python**. It is possible to run the lexer, parser and evaluate (interpret) some small codes. That includes basic arithmetic, function calls and some simple quantum data operations.

In the future, we plan to bring it as a compiled language to **Rust** for optimization, scalability and speed.
